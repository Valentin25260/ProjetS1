                        She was an only child and spent her youth in Pennsylvania, which was not easy to live in a big city like that because her family was quite poor.

                    Gloria Allred recounts the worst time of her life. 
                    She was in her twenties and went on vacation to Mexico with a friend. 
                    There she met a doctor who invited her to dinner and she accepted the invitation. 
                    Once the meal was over he told her "I have to go to the hospital to see my patients". 
                    she decided to accompany him. Then he said "I have to go and see other passers-by
                    who are not in the hospital" she decides to go with him. 
                    She opened the door of the apartment and nobody was in it, the doctor took out a gun and raped her. 
                    She also learned that she was pregnant as a result of the rape, she had to have an abortion but at that time it was forbidden. 
                    at that time was forbidden. She had an illegal abortion and Gloria almost died.
                </p>
        
                <p> 
                    She met Peyton Bray, also a student at the University of Pennsylvania. 
                    They married and she gave birth to her daughter Lisa at the age of 20. 
                    She says that she had never cooked or changed a diaper and that holding her daughter in her arms 
                    in her arms was quite a shock for her. She separated from her husband because of his mental problems 
                    and he ended his life some twenty years later. By telling this story 
                    public she showed that a woman could be strong and stand on her own two feet even at the age of 
                    20 years old.

                <h4> Her fight for feminism </h4>
            
                    <p> 
                        Throughout her life she fought against the inequalities between men and women such as 
                        the differences in price of a menu at a restaurant depending on the sex of the person. 
                        Or the sexist children's shelves. Or she attacked a store that 
                        that charged women more than men for alterations to their clothes.
                    </p>
        
                    <p> 
                        She took on the defense of women against racism, women's rights, sexual abuse 
                        and pedophilia. It was Gloria Allred who defended 20 women who had been sexually abused and drugged by Bill Cosby or 
                        and drugged by Bill Cosby or committed acts against them. This case was publicized 
                        on television and she won the case.
