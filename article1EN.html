            <h4>Beginning of the feminist in France</h4>
        
                <p> 
                    The first French feminists appeared in France in the early 1860s 
                    and end in 1945. André Léo, whose real name was Victoire Léodile Béra, took advantage of the 
                    relative freedom promoted by the second Empire which is directed by Napoleon Bonaparte at that time, 
                    to publish works dedicated to the equality of the sexes. In 1866, she creates 
                    the "Association for the improvement of women's education" and in 1868, she publishes a text defending the equality of 
                    a text defending the equality of the sexes which is at the origin of the first French feminist group. 
                    She was not the only one to defend these ideas, there was also Julie Daubié who was the first woman to obtain the 
                    to obtain the baccalaureate in 1861.

                Despite the beginning of the feminist movement that is starting to become more and more concrete 
                there are some misunderstandings about what is important. One group prefers to emphasize 
                one group prefers to emphasize the education of girls while the other wants civil equality above all. In 1878, 
                takes place the International Congress of the right of the women which is centered on the improvement 
                of the right in the current life (right of work, recognition of the domestic work, etc.). 
                Very few people were interested in political rights, except for a minority of people who demanded 
                equality between men and women.

                The end of the nineteenth century is impacted by the beginning of groups that are created with the aim of having 
                complete equality. The majority of the feminists agree to opt for a strategy 
                on the long term. But this is not the case for all women. Some are more virulent 
                like Hubertine Auclert who wishes the tax strike and to register the women on the electoral lists.

            <h4> The advancement of feminism </h4>
        
                <p> 
                    On July 14, 1881 the first feminist demonstration organized by Hubertine Auclert took place, 
                    this demonstration with goal to stop the refusal to grant rights to the women. Following this 
                    demonstration the word feminism takes all its sense because until now the word was used for men where 
                    men where the virility stopped developing. From the 1890s onwards, more and more feminist 
                    feminist associations are created. Their goal is not the same for all the associations 
                    are each different. In 1891 there is a French federation created to regroup 
                    the feminist societies which will allow to make evolve the rights of the women and 
                    civil rights. Thanks to these movements new rights were accepted like the fact 
                    to be able to divorce.

                In 1909 the feminists created the French Union for Women's Suffrage. 
                The Union evolved rapidly, from 6,000 to 12,000 members from 1912 to 1914. They doubled the number 
                of members in only 2 years. Many newspapers were published at that time such as La Suffragiste 
                by Madeleine Pelletier, the themes discussed were the right to vote, sexual harassment... 
                The first world war slowed down the feminist movement because they privileged the efforts of the war.
                Moreover, women had to stay at home because of the men who had gone to fight. 
                In 1930, the rise of unemployment sent women back to their homes. This period marked the end of the 
                the first wave of feminism. in 1861.

                You will be able to compare the different ways of fighting for the equality and the rights of 
                of women between these 2 times.
