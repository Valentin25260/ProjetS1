            <h4> Her fight for feminism  </h4>
        
                <p> 
                    Taylor Swift is known all over the world for her music and her involvement in feminism. 
                    So I decided to choose this person as today's feminist. 
                    She is 30 years old and is an actress, businesswoman, singer-songwriter. 
                    With more than 40 million records sold worldwide she is one of the greatest artists in history. 
                    in history. She uses her global success and influence to promote women's rights and fight against 
                    and to fight against the inequalities to the women. 
                    Little by little the years pass and her musical style changes, turning to the Pop 
                    It is from this moment that she becomes a figure of feminism.
                </p>

            <p> 
                Her fight for feminism and her convictions about the strength of women are more and more visible in her 
                more and more in her music videos. Before, her music videos were all about being a princess, 
                prejudice of a girl while now Taylor Swift is represented as a heroine and warrior 
                warrior especially in her clip Bad Blood. No more scenes in Disney dresses, now 
                we see scenes of motorcycle races, boxing rings, fights and explosions. 
                We are shown strong women who know how to fight and defend themselves. It is not all she collaborates 
                with Selena Gomez, Zendaya who are also involved in feminism.
    
            </p>
    
            <p> 
                For its second clip entirely feminist realized in 2020 the clip will make a success. 
                The clip "The Man" which was directed, written and played by Taylor Swift denounces the inequalities 
                between men and women and how life is easier as a man. 
                She plays a man with a string of conquests who is rich and respected. 
                She says a feminist message in her chorus "I'm so sick of running as fast as I can, Wondering 
                if I'd get there quicker if I was a man" this sentence tries to make people aware of the difficulties 
                difficulties that women encounter in everyday life
    
            </p>

        <div class="bloc">   
            <h4>Difficult moments of her life</h4>
        
                <p> 
                    In her documentary on the Netflix platform, Taylor denounces the stereotypes of the society on 
                    the woman's physique and the way she should behave. 
                    She was the victim of many criticisms about her body, either too thin or too fat, 
                    She said in an interview "It's just fucking impossible."
                    Taylor Swift suffered a sexual assault in 2013 by a the DJ David Mueller. 
                    Since this assault the feminist became much more involved. 
                    She filed a complaint two years later in 2015. Taylor Swift won the case 1 year later 
                    thanks to this victory she is highlighted during the #MeToo movement.

                To conclude today, Taylor Swift is an icon of feminism, women's struggle and 
                the fight against gender inequality. She wants to change the vision and the prejudices that 
                people have about women. This feminist doesn't only show her fans but everyone what the 
                the world what the rights and freedoms of women are.
